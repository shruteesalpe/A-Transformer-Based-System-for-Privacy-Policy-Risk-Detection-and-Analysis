# Privacy Policy Risk Detector: A Transformer-Based Multi-Label Classification System

This repository contains the implementation of a transformer-based system designed to automatically detect privacy risks in online privacy policies. The system employs the DistilBERT architecture and a custom multi-label classification framework to identify data practices such as information collection, third-party sharing, retention, security, and user control mechanisms.

The objective of this project is to support automated compliance analysis and privacy governance by providing structured predictions derived from unstructured policy text.

# Abstract

Privacy policies are often lengthy and difficult for users to interpret. Automated systems that classify privacy practices can improve transparency and compliance monitoring. This project presents a Privacy Policy Risk Detector trained on the OPP-115 dataset using a DistilBERT model fine-tuned for multi-label classification. The model integrates a weighted loss function to address label imbalance and uses safe-text augmentation to reduce false positives. A Streamlit application is included for interactive inference and demonstration.

# System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Processing Module**  
   - Loads and preprocesses the OPP-115 dataset  
   - Tokenizes policy segments using Hugging Face tokenizers  
   - Supports integration of additional safe-text samples  

2. **Model Training Module**  
   - Fine-tunes DistilBERT using supervised multi-label classification  
   - Employs BCEWithLogitsLoss with class-specific weights  
   - Outputs evaluation metrics such as Micro-F1, precision, recall, and accuracy  

3. **Inference and Deployment Module**  
   - Includes a Streamlit-based interface for real-time predictions  
   - Provides multi-label confidence scores  
   - Supports batch or single-text inference  

4. **Model Storage and Checkpointing**  
   - Trained models and tokenizers are saved in the `privacy_model/` directory  
   - Intermediate checkpoints and logs are stored under `results/`
